A bootloader is a piece of software located on a special 4KB sector of the drive known as the Master Boot Record (MBR). The MBR is the first sector of the drive by convention, and the operating system will write the bootloader to the sector as part of it's installation. When your computer powers on, it loads its first instruction of the bootloader from an address that is in fact right at the top of the 32-bit address space, FFFFFFF0, and begins executing in 32bit unreal mode. This is the demarcation point in the boot process between the BIOS and bootloader, and triggers the portion of the boot process that is controlled by the bootloader and operating system.

EFI firmwares in general switch to protected mode within a few instructions of exiting processor reset. Switching to protected mode is done early on in the so-called "SEC Phase" of EFI firmware initialization. Technically, 32-bit and greater x86 processors don't even start in real mode proper, but in what is colloquially known as unreal mode. (The initial segment descriptor for the CS register does not describe the conventional real mode mapping and is what makes this "unreal".) The EFI doesn't load a bootstrap program from sector #0 of a disc at all. They bootstrap by means of the EFI Boot Manager loading and running an EFI boot loader application. Such programs are run in protected mode.

As such, it could be said that those EFI systems never enter real mode proper at all. When bootstrapping natively to an EFI bootloader and not employing a compatibility support module, they switch from unreal mode directly to protected mode and stay in protected mode from then on.

The bootloader can be written in most languages that compile into X86 assembly, usually Assembler, C, and C++. Recently Rust and C# with .NET Native have entered the fray as new options. This project is written in C++ with the MSVC toolchain, with some assembly to create the entry point and interupt calls. In the spirit of running bare metal, this project avoids using stdlib or any other libraries.

We'll be using Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017 in administrator mode as the shell environment. we'll need to add NASM (Netwide Assembler) and Qemu to the path
%PATH%="%PATH%;C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\bin\NASM;C:\Program Files\qemu"

Creating the disk image for UEFI
The UEFI specification allows you to create applications that the firmware can run during the boot process. This is what we will use to load the operating system. These applications must be stored on a FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32 file system and located on a hard disk with a GPT partition. So our first step is to create a virtual hard disk that is ready to accept a UEFI application.

The following will create the disk image on the V:\ drive
diskpart
create vdisk file=C:\projectrepo\images\kernel.vhd maximum=512
select vdisk file=C:\projectrepo\images\kernel.vhd
attach vdisk
convert gpt
create partition efi size=200
create partition primary
format fs=fat32 quick
assign letter=V
exit

Let's build a simple efi script and run it to test everything done so far. (Thanks Brian Otto)

Assemble this with NASM to get kernel.obj. Add nasm.exe to the path first
nasm -f win64 kernel.asm

Link the object file as a UEFI application and set its entry point.
This will create a C:\kernel.efi file, which is a PE32+ DLL with a EFI subsystem.
link /subsystem:EFI_APPLICATION /entry:_start kernel.obj

Copy the UEFI app to the disk image. The firmware will search for this special path
mkdir V:\EFI
mkdir V:\EFI\BOOT
copy kernel.efi V:\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI


Detach the virtual hard disk so that other applications can use it.
diskpart
select vdisk file=C:\kernel.vhd
detach vdisk
exit
